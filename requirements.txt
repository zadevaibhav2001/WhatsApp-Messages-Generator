# No external dependencies required
# This project uses only Python standard library modules:
# - subprocess (for running AppleScript and clipboard operations)
# - time (for delays between messages)
# - re (for regular expressions and text formatting)
# - pathlib (for file path operations)

# All functionality is built using macOS system utilities and Python built-ins
